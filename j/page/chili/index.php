		<ul>
			<li>1.5lbs cubed venison (other meats should be good too, but I like to use my own venison)
			<li>1 large white onion
			<li>16oz chili beans
			<li>15oz diced tomatoes italian style
			<li>6oz tomato paste
			<li>12oz lager beer (stout seems to work too)
			<li>12g or so assorted dried hot peppers
		</ul>

		<ol>
			<li>Brown the meat on high heat with minimal oil to give it a nice char
			<li>Chop the onion into chunks - I like them larger
			<li>Cut the peppers up into tiny pieces (I use scissors) and include the seeds
			<li>Add everything to a slow cooker and cook on high for 3 hours
			<li>Leave in the fridge overnight
		</ol>

		<div>I like to have it with generously buttered toast.</div>
